      <h2>The Heartbeat of Austin: A Complete Guide to HAAM Day 2025</h2>

      <p>On Tuesday, September 23, 2025, Austin's identity as the "Live Music Capital of the World" will come alive as
        the citywide HAAM Day Music Festival celebrates its 20th anniversary. This annual event is the world's largest
        one-day, all-local music festival, featuring an incredible lineup of more than 300 musicians performing over 250
        free shows at more than 100 venues across Central Texas. HAAM Day is not just a festival; it's a citywide
        fundraiser to support the Health Alliance for Austin Musicians (HAAM), an organization that provides affordable
        healthcare services to Austin's low-income, working musicians.</p>

        layout="responsive"></amp-img>

      <p>The festival truly transforms Austin into a live music destination, with performances happening everywhere from
        iconic music halls to unexpected places like grocery stores and airport terminals. It is a testament to the
        community's commitment to protecting the people who create the soundtrack of the city.</p>

      <h3>A Citywide Showcase: Artists and Venues</h3>
      <p>The 2025 HAAM Day Music Festival promises a diverse and expansive lineup, with something for every musical
        taste. The day kicks off bright and early with live music starting at 6 a.m. at the H-E-B on South Congress,
        featuring artists like Scrappy Jud Newcomb and Troy Campbell. Later in the day, showcases will pop up at various
        H-E-B locations, including Nutty Brown and Hancock Center.</p>
      <p>Iconic Austin venues are also at the heart of the festival, with curated showcases at legendary spots like
        Stubb's Bar-B-Q, Central Machine Works, and The ABGB. Fans can also catch intimate performances at beloved clubs
        like The Continental Club, Guero's Oak Garden, and Antone's Nightclub. The festival also includes unique
        showcases at locations like the Texas State Capitol steps, where singer-songwriter Gina Chavez is scheduled to
        perform.</p>
      <p>Other participating venues and businesses that will be filled with live music throughout the day include: Amy’s
        Ice Creams, Dell Children’s Medical Center and Dell Seton Medical Center, Schlotzsky’s, ThunderCloud Subs,
        Tacodeli, Waterloo Records & Video, The Long Center, YETI Flagship, The Trail Conservancy, Hotel Vegas, and
        Meanwhile Brewing Co.</p>

      <h3>Featured Artists</h3>
      <p>The sheer volume of artists participating is staggering. The lineup features both established legends and
        emerging talent, including Bob Schneider, The Watters, The Peterson Brothers, Ruthie Craft, Sir Woman, Rey
        Arteaga, Theo Love, Pedal Steel Noah, McKenna Michaels, Mixer Rogers, Courtney Santana, and Chief Cleopatra. The
        festival also includes performances from acts like The Criticals, S.G. Goodman, Soul Man Sam, and Wook Wizard,
        who conjures up a full-band sound as a solo act. The diverse list of participating artists also includes Rey
        Arteaga, Ella Reid, Bonnie Whitmore, Graham Wilkinson, and Paula Maya, among many others.</p>

      <h3>A Mission Powered by the Community</h3>
      <p>The primary goal of HAAM Day is to raise awareness and funds for the Health Alliance for Austin Musicians.
        Since 2005, HAAM has helped over 3,200 local musicians access more than $200 million in healthcare services,
        from basic checkups to dental work and mental health support. Every dollar raised on HAAM Day is leveraged into
        significant healthcare services, with every $200 in donations turning into $1,400 in direct healthcare.</p>
      <p>This year's fundraising goal is to surpass the over $800,000 raised in the previous year, and the community has
        stepped up to help. The festival is powered by a network of dedicated sponsors, partners, and individual
        fundraisers.</p>

      <h3>Key Sponsors and Community Partners</h3>
      <p>The event is presented by PNC, SXSW, and C3 Presents. Other major sponsors and community supporters include:
