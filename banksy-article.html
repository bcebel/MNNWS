        <h2>Banksy Strikes Again: New Mural at Royal Courts of Justice Ignites Free Speech Debate</h2>

        <p>The elusive street artist Banksy has once again captured public attention with a provocative new mural, this time on the side of the historic Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork, which appeared overnight, is a powerful and unambiguous critique of a controversial new law, thrusting the debate over free speech and protest rights into the spotlight.</p>

        <amp-img src="assets/banksy2.webp" alt="The new Banksy mural" class="article-image" width="1024" height="683" layout="responsive"></amp-img>

        <h3>The Artwork's Powerful Message</h3>
        <p>The mural depicts a judge, complete with a traditional wig and gown, viciously beating a protester with a gavel. The protester lies on the ground, clutching a placard spattered with what appears to be blood. The stark and violent imagery leaves little room for interpretation, pointing a direct finger at the justice system and its role in suppressing dissent.</p>

        <h3>A Commentary on a Controversial Law</h3>
        <p>The artwork is widely seen as a commentary on a recently passed law that bans public support for Palestine Action, a pro-Palestinian protest group known for its direct-action tactics. The law has drawn widespread criticism from human rights organizations and legal experts, who argue that it infringes on fundamental rights to free speech and assembly. By placing this mural on the very walls of the Royal Courts of Justice, Banksy is challenging the legal establishment that is tasked with upholding these new restrictions.</p>

        <h3>An Uncertain Future for the Mural</h3>
        <p>The appearance of a Banksy mural always creates a dilemma for property owners and city officials. In this case, the situation is particularly complex. The Royal Courts of Justice is a Grade I listed building, meaning it is protected for its historical and architectural significance. HM Courts and Tribunals Service has stated that they are "obliged to maintain its original character."</p>

        <amp-img src="assets/banksy3.webp" alt="Close up of the mural's texture on the building" class="article-image" width="1024" height="683" layout="responsive"></amp-img>

        <p>While some Banksy pieces are protected or even sold for millions, others are quickly removed. For now, the image remains stained onto the Portland stone of the 143-year-old complex, a stark and public reminder of the spectacle the art created and the ongoing debate it represents. Whether it will be preserved as a significant piece of political art or scrubbed away to maintain the building's facade remains to be seen.</p>
