<h2>Digging for Gold: A Guide to Austin's Best Record Shops</h2>
<p>In a city that lives and breathes music, it's no surprise that Austin is home to a fantastic collection of record stores. These shops are more than just retail spaces; they are cultural hubs for music lovers, places of discovery, and vital parts of the city's artistic ecosystem. Whether you're a seasoned collector or a new vinyl enthusiast, here are six of the best record shops Austin has to offer.</p>
<h3>1. Waterloo Records

Waterloo Records is the undisputed king of Austin record stores. An institution since 1982, this massive, 6,400-square-foot space is a must-visit for any music fan. It's bright, well-organized, and boasts an enormous selection of new and used vinyl, CDs, and DVDs across every genre imaginable. The staff is famously knowledgeable and passionate, and the store frequently hosts intimate in-store performances. If you only have time to visit one record store in Austin, this is the one.

<h3>2. End of an Ear

For the serious record collector, End of an Ear is a paradise. This South Austin shop is meticulously curated, offering a deep and diverse selection of new and used vinyl, with a particular strength in indie rock, experimental, jazz, and international music. The atmosphere is a bit more serious and reverent than Waterloo, and the staff are true aficionados. It's the kind of place you can spend hours in, digging through the crates and discovering hidden gems.

<h3>3. Breakaway Records

If you're looking for vintage soul, funk, and jazz, Breakaway Records is your spot. Located in the North Loop neighborhood, Breakaway specializes in used vinyl, with a focus on hard-to-find LPs and 45s. The store is well-organized and the pricing is fair, making it a favorite among local DJs and collectors. It's a smaller, more focused shop with a clear passion for its chosen genres.

<h3>4. Antone's Record Shop

Located next door to the legendary blues club of the same name, Antone's Record Shop is a shrine to the blues and its many offshoots. The shop specializes in blues, soul, R&B, and Texas music. It's a small but mighty store, packed with character and history. It's the perfect place to pick up a classic blues record before or after catching a show at the club.

<h3>5. Feels So Good

Feels So Good is more than just a record store; it's a creative hub. This South Austin spot combines a well-curated selection of new and used vinyl with a screen printing shop and an art gallery. The vibe is cool, creative, and very Austin. It's a great place to discover local artists, both on vinyl and on the walls.

<h3>6. Piranha Records

Located in the North Campus area, Piranha Records is a classic, old-school record store. They offer a solid mix of new and used vinyl, CDs, and DVDs, with a focus on rock, punk, and metal. They also sell smoking accessories, giving the shop a classic counter-culture vibe. It's a great neighborhood store with a loyal following.
