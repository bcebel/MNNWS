# How to Stay Cool in Austin (Literally and Figuratively)

Austin is a city that prides itself on its "cool" factor. But in a place where summer temperatures regularly top 100 degrees, the concept of "cool" has two very important meanings. Hereâ€™s a guide to mastering both: how to beat the Texas heat, and how to tap into the city's unique cultural vibe.

## How to Stay Cool: The Literal Guide

Surviving, and even enjoying, an Austin summer is an art form. It's all about finding water, shade, and a good attitude.

*   **Master the Holy Trinity of Swimming:** Austin's identity is deeply connected to its swimming holes.
    *   **Barton Springs Pool:** This three-acre, spring-fed pool in the heart of Zilker Park maintains a refreshing 68-70 degree temperature year-round. It's a quintessential Austin experience.
    *   **Deep Eddy Pool:** The oldest swimming pool in Texas, this man-made pool is also spring-fed and offers a more traditional public pool experience with lap lanes and plenty of space to relax.
    *   **The Greenbelt:** The Barton Creek Greenbelt is a network of trails with several popular swimming spots (like Twin Falls and Sculpture Falls) that appear when the water levels are right. It's a perfect combination of a hike and a swim.

*   **Take a Day Trip:** The surrounding Hill Country is dotted with stunning natural swimming holes. Consider a short drive to the cypress-lined **Krause Springs** in Spicewood or the beautiful **Blue Hole** in Wimberley.

*   **Embrace Air Conditioning:** There's no shame in seeking refuge indoors. Catch a movie at the **Alamo Drafthouse** (where you can get a meal and a drink delivered to your seat), explore the **Blanton Museum of Art**, or visit the **Bullock Texas State History Museum**.

*   **Drink Your Cool:** Sometimes, the best relief comes in a glass. A frozen margarita on a hot patio is a Texas tradition for a reason. For a non-alcoholic option, seek out one of the many local snow cone stands for a sweet, icy treat.

## How to Stay Cool: The Figurative Guide

Being "cool" in Austin isn't about being exclusive or aloof. It's about being engaged, curious, and willing to explore the things that make the city unique.

*   **Eat Like a Local:** Go beyond the famous restaurants and explore the city's legendary food truck scene. Some of the best and most innovative food in Austin is served out of a trailer in a park. Find a neighborhood gem in East Austin or a classic diner in South Austin.

*   **See Music the Austin Way:** While the big festivals are fun, the real Austin music experience is seeing a local band at a small club. Go to The Continental Club, The Saxon Pub, or The White Horse on a weeknight. You'll experience the city's musical soul up close.

*   **Get Outside (When It's Not 100 Degrees):** The "cool" Austin lifestyle is an active one. Hike the Greenbelt in the morning, kayak or paddleboard on Lady Bird Lake, or just hang out with friends at Zilker Park.

*   **Support Local:** Instead of big box stores, check out the independent boutiques on South Congress or in the North Loop. Visit a farmers' market on the weekend. The spirit of "Keep Austin Weird" is best found in the small, independent businesses that give the city its character.

*   **Bleed Verde:** One of the newest and most exciting ways to feel like a local is to embrace the city's MLS team, Austin FC. The atmosphere at a home game at Q2 Stadium is electric and has quickly become a cornerstone of Austin's modern culture. Go to a game and cheer on the home team.
