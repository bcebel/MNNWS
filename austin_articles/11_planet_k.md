# What is Planet K? An Explanation of the Austin Institution

If you're new to Austin, you've likely seen the distinctive, often colorful storefronts for a place called "Planet K." And you might have wondered, "What exactly *is* Planet K?" The name is whimsical, but the answer is simple: Planet K is a long-standing Austin institution and a classic example of the "Keep Austin Weird" spirit in retail form.

## It's Not a Planet, It's a Head Shop

At its core, Planet K is a chain of smoke shops, or "head shops." For decades, it has been the go-to spot in Austin and surrounding areas for a wide variety of smoking-related products. This includes:

*   A massive selection of pipes, from simple glass pieces to intricate water pipes.
*   Tobacco and tobacco-related products.
*   Vaporizers and e-cigarette supplies.
*   A wide range of rolling papers, grinders, and other accessories.

Due to its long history and wide selection, Planet K has been voted "Austin's Best Smoke Shop" on multiple occasions, solidifying its status as a leader in this retail category.

## More Than Just a Smoke Shop

What truly makes Planet K an Austin institution is everything else it sells. A trip to Planet K is an adventure in novelty, humor, and counter-culture. The stores are packed with an eclectic and often "naughty" mix of items. You can find:

*   Gag gifts and humorous novelties.
*   Incense, candles, and tapestries.
*   A selection of adult toys and risqu√© greeting cards.
*   Clothing, stickers, and other items that celebrate a "weird" and alternative lifestyle.

As the Austin Chronicle once cheekily noted, there is "plenty of giggle opportunity" inside. It's a place that doesn't take itself too seriously and invites customers to explore their playful and irreverent side.

## A Piece of Austin's Culture

Planet K is more than just a store; it's a reflection of a certain part of Austin's culture. It represents the city's independent, non-conformist, and slightly rebellious streak. The business is also involved in the local community, sponsoring events like fireworks shows and supporting local charities.

So, while it may not be an actual planet, Planet K is very much its own world. It's a quirky, beloved, and undeniably weird institution that has been a part of the Austin landscape for years, offering a unique retail experience that you're unlikely to find anywhere else.
