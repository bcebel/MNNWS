      <h2>Austin's Culinary Scene: The Best Restaurants (That Aren't BBQ)</h2>
      <amp-img src="../assets/austin.webp" alt="Austin" class="article-image" width="1024" height="683"
        layout="responsive"></amp-img>
      <p>While Austin is famous for its world-class barbecue, the city's culinary landscape is far from one-note. From
        high-end tasting menus to iconic Tex-Mex institutions, Austin is a food lover's paradise. Here is a guide to 10
        of the best and most essential non-BBQ restaurants in the city.</p>
      <h2>Fine Dining &amp; Special Occasions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Pasta | Bar:</strong> For a truly special occasion, Pasta | Bar offers an intimate and exclusive
          experience. This tasting-menu-only restaurant serves a creative, multi-course meal centered around innovative
          pasta dishes, all served from a 10-seat counter. It's a tough reservation to get, but worth the effort for a
          memorable culinary adventure.</li>
        <li><strong>Hestia:</strong> Named for the Greek goddess of the hearth, Hestia is a modern restaurant centered
          around a massive, 20-foot wood-fired hearth. The menu features sophisticated, seasonal dishes with a smoky,
          live-fire element. The atmosphere is sleek and upscale, making it a perfect spot for an impressive dinner.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Arlo Grey:</strong> Located in the stylish LINE Hotel, Arlo Grey is the brainchild of "Top Chef"
          winner Kristen Kish. The menu is a beautiful blend of French and Italian techniques with Texas ingredients,
          resulting in dishes that are both comforting and elegant. The lakeside setting and chic decor add to the
          special-occasion feel.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Upscale Casual &amp; Trendy</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Aba:</strong> One of the most beautiful restaurants in Austin, Aba's stunning, tree-filled patio is
          a destination in itself. The menu features Mediterranean and Israeli-inspired cuisine, with a focus on
          shareable small plates, kebabs, and hummus. It's a vibrant, see-and-be-seen spot that's perfect for a group
          dinner or a romantic evening.</li>
        <li><strong>Odd Duck:</strong> If one restaurant could encapsulate the modern Austin food scene, it might be Odd
          Duck. With a focus on creative, locally-sourced small plates, Odd Duck has been a pioneer of the farm-to-table
          movement in Austin. The menu is constantly changing, the cocktails are inventive, and the atmosphere is always
          buzzing.</li>
        <li><strong>Loro:</strong> What do you get when you combine the talents of the chefs behind Franklin Barbecue
          and the acclaimed sushi restaurant Uchi? You get Loro, an Asian smokehouse. It's not a traditional BBQ joint;
          instead, it blends Texas smoking techniques with Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese flavors. The result is a
          delicious and unique menu in a casual, counter-service beer garden setting.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Cuisine-Specific Standouts</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Suerte:</strong> Suerte is a modern Mexican restaurant that takes its masa (corn dough) program very
          seriously. They nixtamalize and grind their own corn in-house, which forms the basis for their incredible
          tortillas, tacos, and other dishes. The menu is creative and vibrant, and the cocktails are top-notch.</li>
        <li><strong>Uchi:</strong> Uchi is a sushi institution that helped put Austin on the national culinary map. Chef
          Tyson Cole's innovative approach to sushi and Japanese cuisine has earned the restaurant countless accolades.
          It's a high-end experience known for its pristine fish, creative flavor combinations, and impeccable service.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Dai Due:</strong> Dai Due is a butcher shop and restaurant with a hyper-local focus. The menu is a
          celebration of Texas ingredients, with a particular emphasis on wild game, heritage-breed pork, and local
          produce. It's a unique and rustic dining experience that is deeply connected to the land.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>A Classic Institution</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Matt's El Rancho:</strong> Since 1952, Matt's El Rancho has been serving classic Tex-Mex to
          generations of Austinites. This sprawling, old-school restaurant is an institution, famous for its strong
          margaritas, Bob Armstrong Dip, and lively, family-friendly atmosphere. It's not trendy or innovative; it's
          timeless, consistent, and a beloved part of Austin's cultural fabric.</li>
