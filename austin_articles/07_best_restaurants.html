<h2>Austin's Culinary Scene: The Best Restaurants (That Aren't BBQ)</h2>
<p>While Austin is famous for its world-class barbecue, the city's culinary landscape is far from one-note. From high-end tasting menus to iconic Tex-Mex institutions, Austin is a food lover's paradise. Here is a guide to 10 of the best and most essential non-BBQ restaurants in the city.</p>
<h2>Fine Dining &amp; Special Occasions</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pasta | Bar:</strong> For a truly special occasion, Pasta | Bar offers an intimate and exclusive experience. This tasting-menu-only restaurant serves a creative, multi-course meal centered around innovative pasta dishes, all served from a 10-seat counter. It's a tough reservation to get, but worth the effort for a memorable culinary adventure.</li>
<li><strong>Hestia:</strong> Named for the Greek goddess of the hearth, Hestia is a modern restaurant centered around a massive, 20-foot wood-fired hearth. The menu features sophisticated, seasonal dishes with a smoky, live-fire element. The atmosphere is sleek and upscale, making it a perfect spot for an impressive dinner.</li>
<li><strong>Arlo Grey:</strong> Located in the stylish LINE Hotel, Arlo Grey is the brainchild of "Top Chef" winner Kristen Kish. The menu is a beautiful blend of French and Italian techniques with Texas ingredients, resulting in dishes that are both comforting and elegant. The lakeside setting and chic decor add to the special-occasion feel.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Upscale Casual &amp; Trendy</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Aba:</strong> One of the most beautiful restaurants in Austin, Aba's stunning, tree-filled patio is a destination in itself. The menu features Mediterranean and Israeli-inspired cuisine, with a focus on shareable small plates, kebabs, and hummus. It's a vibrant, see-and-be-seen spot that's perfect for a group dinner or a romantic evening.</li>
<li><strong>Odd Duck:</strong> If one restaurant could encapsulate the modern Austin food scene, it might be Odd Duck. With a focus on creative, locally-sourced small plates, Odd Duck has been a pioneer of the farm-to-table movement in Austin. The menu is constantly changing, the cocktails are inventive, and the atmosphere is always buzzing.</li>
<li><strong>Loro:</strong> What do you get when you combine the talents of the chefs behind Franklin Barbecue and the acclaimed sushi restaurant Uchi? You get Loro, an Asian smokehouse. It's not a traditional BBQ joint; instead, it blends Texas smoking techniques with Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese flavors. The result is a delicious and unique menu in a casual, counter-service beer garden setting.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Cuisine-Specific Standouts</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Suerte:</strong> Suerte is a modern Mexican restaurant that takes its masa (corn dough) program very seriously. They nixtamalize and grind their own corn in-house, which forms the basis for their incredible tortillas, tacos, and other dishes. The menu is creative and vibrant, and the cocktails are top-notch.</li>
<li><strong>Uchi:</strong> Uchi is a sushi institution that helped put Austin on the national culinary map. Chef Tyson Cole's innovative approach to sushi and Japanese cuisine has earned the restaurant countless accolades. It's a high-end experience known for its pristine fish, creative flavor combinations, and impeccable service.</li>
<li><strong>Dai Due:</strong> Dai Due is a butcher shop and restaurant with a hyper-local focus. The menu is a celebration of Texas ingredients, with a particular emphasis on wild game, heritage-breed pork, and local produce. It's a unique and rustic dining experience that is deeply connected to the land.</li>
</ol>
<h2>A Classic Institution</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Matt's El Rancho:</strong> Since 1952, Matt's El Rancho has been serving classic Tex-Mex to generations of Austinites. This sprawling, old-school restaurant is an institution, famous for its strong margaritas, Bob Armstrong Dip, and lively, family-friendly atmosphere. It's not trendy or innovative; it's timeless, consistent, and a beloved part of Austin's cultural fabric.</li>
