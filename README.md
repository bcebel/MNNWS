# Minnow News Network - A Zine for the Ages

Welcome to the Minnow News Network, your new favorite corner of the internet, broadcasting straight from the heart of Austin, TX. We are a digital zine for the curious, the creative, and the independent spirits who believe that even small voices can make big waves.

## Our Philosophy: The Minnow in the Machine

In the vast ocean of the interweb, it's easy to feel like a small fish. But just like a school of minnows, we believe there's strength in numbers and beauty in the collective. We are the David to the internet's Goliath, a testament to the power of individual voices coming together to tell stories that matter. We're all just people navigating this digital world, and here, we're building a community that celebrates that.

## What We're About

From the weird and wonderful of Austin's local art scene to deep dives into culture, tech, and everything in between, we're here to share stories that spark curiosity and connection. Think of us as your friendly neighborhood zine, but for a global audience.

This project is more than just a website; it's a platform for discovery, a place to get lost in compelling narratives and emerge with a fresh perspective.

## Join the School

We're just getting started, and we're thrilled to have you swim along with us.
