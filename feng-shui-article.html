        <h2>Feng Shui Made Mobile: Instantly Map Your Home's Energy with bcebel.github.io/3d</h2>
      </header>

      <p>Harnessing the ancient art of Feng Shui no longer requires complex compasses or lengthy calculations. A powerful, accessible tool has emerged, turning your mobile phone into a sophisticated 360-degree guide to the energetic map of your space: the web app located at <a href="https://bcebel.github.io/3d" target="_blank">bcebel.github.io/3d</a>.</p>
      <p>This innovative online compass and 3D environment allows anyone to instantly visualize the flow of Qi (life energy) in their surroundings, revealing the associated Bagua sectors, their governing elements, and their Yin or Yang polarity—all based on your phone's real-time orientation.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>How to Map Your Space Instantly (Mobile Use)</h3>
        <p>The tool is designed to be used on a mobile device, leveraging its internal magnetometer and gyroscope to provide an accurate reading of your physical location relative to true North.</p>
        <p>Here is the simple, three-step process to activate your personalized Feng Shui map:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Allow Compass Access:</strong> When you first load the site, your browser will prompt you to allow access to your device’s orientation sensors (i.e., the compass). You must grant this permission for the tool to function.</li>
            <li><strong>Align to North (360/0):</strong> With access granted, rotate until the on-screen compass is aligned precisely with 360 degrees or 0 degrees, which represents true North.</li>
            <li><strong>Enter the 3D Environment:</strong> Once aligned, proceed to the 360/3D environment within the application. This view dynamically uses your phone's orientation to show you the elemental map as you physically turn in a circle.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As you rotate your body and phone, the screen will display the current direction, the corresponding Bagua life sector (e.g., Wealth, Health, Relationship), its governing element (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water), and its fundamental Yin or Yang energy.</p>

        <h3>A Powerful Center Point: Reading the Elemental Flow</h3>
        <p>To gain the most profound insight into your home's energy dynamics, the most powerful place to use this tool is the center.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Using the Center of Your Home (Tai Chi)</h3>
        <p>In Feng Shui, the center of your entire home is known as the Tai Chi—the energetic heart of the space. It is the place where all energies meet and from which the Qi radiates outwards to influence every other sector.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Find the Center:</strong> Use a floor plan or a measuring app to locate the exact center point of your entire living area (or, for a simpler approach, the center of the main floor).</li>
          <li><strong>Stand and Orient:</strong> Stand on this central spot with your phone. Once you have aligned the compass to North (Step 2), slowly rotate 360 degrees, watching the 3D map.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By using the compass from this central vantage point, you can clearly visualize the flow of the elements as they project into the surrounding rooms. You can determine:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Which elemental energies are dominant in specific areas (e.g., strong Fire in the South, solid Earth in the Northeast).</li>
          <li>How the elements are interacting (e.g., if a sector is dominated by a controlling or exhausting element, indicating an imbalance that needs adjustment).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Using the Center of a Single Room</h3>
        <p>If you are focusing on a specific area, such as an office or bedroom, repeating the process from the room's center provides a more focused elemental map. This helps you ensure that the elements and Yin/Yang balance in that specific space are conducive to the room's function (e.g., a quiet, Yin-dominant sector for a bedroom, or an active, Yang-dominant sector for a workspace).</p>
        <p>By combining advanced mobile technology with ancient wisdom, bcebel.github.io/3d gives you the power to see, understand, and refine the energy of your environment, moving your practice from theory to an immediate, dynamic reality.</p>
